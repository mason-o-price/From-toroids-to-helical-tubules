To generate the triangular surface meshes of the curved tubules presented in this publication, we run the toroidSimulation.m MATLAB script (which uses the functions present here). Within this script, the user can specify the desired geometric parameters, and tune the necessary simulation parameters, such as the number of timesteps before terminating the energy minimzation protocol.
