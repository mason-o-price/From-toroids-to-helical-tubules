This respository includes:
- MATLAB code used to generate triangulated geometries for curved tubules in [`generating geometries`](https://github.com/mason-o-price/From-toroids-to-helical-tubules/tree/main/generating%20geometries).
- Python scripts to generate input json files for KMC simulations, and Python/Bash scripts to organize and read the simulation results, under [`KMC Simulation Scripts`](https://github.com/mason-o-price/From-toroids-to-helical-tubules/tree/main/KMC%20simulation%20scripts)
