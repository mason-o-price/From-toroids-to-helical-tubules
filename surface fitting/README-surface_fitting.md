To measure the geometric parameters of generated triangular meshes, we fit parametrized surfaces to the set of vertices in a given mesh (see SI section 4.A of the present publication). To accomplish this, we run surface_fitting.py. In this script, we specify the file storing the coordinate data (from the `coordinateData' folder), and specify the approximate geometric parameters to inform the initial conditions of the optimization algorithm.
